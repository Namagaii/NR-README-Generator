# README-Generator ![LicenseBadge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-red.svg)
  ## Description
  This project was developed as a useful introduction to node js,node modules, and packages. Using inquirer and fs I was able to develop a command line application that would take input from the user and generate a readme file based on what they inputted. It also dynamically generated a badge for the license the user wanted to use and added a link to the license.
  ## Installation
  Simply download the folders and navigate to the directory on a command line with nodejs, run npm install and type node index into the terminal.
  ## Usage
  This program can be used to generate a .md file and fill in the following information:Title, Installation,Usage, License (Only accepts the licenses in this [file](“./licenses.json”) identified by its key value), How to Contribute, How to test, Contact Information
  ## License
  Licensed under the [MIT](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
  ## Contribute
  If you would like to contribute simply contact me with the info in the [contact](#Contact) section and I will reply and if I like the idea work with you to implement it (crediting you of course).
  ## Test
  test.js file will be added soon to easily test the functionality but until then simply running the program as outlined in [installation](#Installation) and following the prompts works just fine.
